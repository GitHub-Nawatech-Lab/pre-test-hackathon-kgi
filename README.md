## üìå Rules and Guidelines
### üîÄ Pull Requests

1. **Branching:** 
   - Create a new branch from the `main` branch for any changes or new features.
   - Use a descriptive branch name, such as `hackathon/[your_team_name]`.

2. **Commits:** 
   - Keep commits small and meaningful.
   - Each commit should focus on a single task or update.

3. **Pull Request:** 
   - Submit pull requests with a clear summary of what was changed or implemented.
   - Reference any issues or milestones when relevant.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Working in Azure Machine Learning
1. **Setup:**
   - Confirm that you have access to an Azure Machine Learning workspace.
   - Clone this repository to your local machine or directly into the Azure workspace.

2. **Environment:**
   - Create a Python environment and install all necessary packages.
   - Maintain a `requirements.txt` file inside each `Case_[case_number]` folder.

3. **Notebooks:**
   - Open or create Jupyter notebooks within Azure Machine Learning Studio.
   - Keep notebooks organized and well-documented with markdown cells to explain your code and results.
   - Develop your models within these notebooks, ensuring clarity and coherence in your explanations.

4. **Execution:**
   - Run the notebooks in sequence to maintain the correct flow of data processing and model training.
   - Validate results, and carefully document any issues or anomalies that arise.

### ü§ñ Model Creation
1. **Feature Engineering:** 
   - Perform essential data preprocessing steps, including normalization, feature selection, and handling missing values.

2. **Model Selection:** 
   - Experiment with various machine learning and deep learning models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.

3. **Training:** 
   - Split your data into training and testing sets.
   - Train your models using suitable techniques and hyperparameters.

4. **Evaluation:** 
   - Evaluate model performance using suitable metrics like MAE, RMSE, and others
   - Document and compare the results across different models to identify the best performer.

### üöÄ Submitting to GitHub
1. **Updates:**
   - Regularly update your local branch with the latest changes from the main branch to avoid conflicts.

2. **Commits:**
   - Make meaningful commits with clear messages that describe the changes made.

3. **Push:**
   - Push your local branch to GitHub using the command:

   ```sh
   git push origin hackathon/[your_team_name]
   ```
