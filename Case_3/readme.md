## 📊 Dataset Description

This dataset contains operational parameters from an iron ore flotation process. Below are the descriptions for each feature:

### 📅 Date and Timestamp
- **Description**: Indicates the specific date and time of each observation or measurement.

---

### 🔩 % Iron Feed
- **Description**: The percentage of iron content in the iron ore that is fed into the flotation cells.
- **Importance**: Higher % Iron Feed means better ore quality entering the process.

---

### 🧪 % Silica Feed
- **Description**: The percentage of silica (impurity) in the iron ore that is fed into the flotation cells.
- **Importance**: Silica is an undesirable impurity that must be reduced; lower values are better.

---

### 🌽 Starch Flow
- **Description**: The flow rate of starch (used as a depressant reagent) in the flotation process.
- **Unit**: m³/h (cubic meters per hour)

---

### 🧴 Amina Flow
- **Description**: The flow rate of amina (used as a collector reagent) in the flotation process.
- **Unit**: m³/h (cubic meters per hour)

---

### 💧 Ore Pulp Flow
- **Description**: The total flow of the iron ore pulp into the flotation system.
- **Unit**: t/h (tons per hour)

---

### 🧪 Ore Pulp pH
- **Description**: The acidity/alkalinity level of the ore pulp.
- **Scale**: 0 (acidic) to 14 (alkaline); neutral = 7

---

### ⚖️ Ore Pulp Density
- **Description**: The density of the ore pulp.
- **Unit**: kg/cm³  
- **Typical Range**: 1 to 3 kg/cm³

---

### 🌬️ Flotation Column 01 Air Flow
- **Description**: The airflow entering the first flotation column.
- **Unit**: Nm³/h (normal cubic meters per hour)

---

### 🌬️ Flotation Column 02 Air Flow
- **Description**: The airflow entering the second flotation column.
- **Unit**: Nm³/h (normal cubic meters per hour)
