# Silica Quality Prediction in Mining Process
## ðŸ§  Overview
This project aims to predict the percentage of silica in the final product of an iron ore flotation process. Silica is an undesirable impurity that directly affects the quality of the ore, and accurate prediction enables better process control and product optimization.

By leveraging operational parameters from the flotation process, we apply machine learning models to forecast silica levels in real time, helping engineers take proactive decisions to maintain high product quality.

## ðŸš€ Use Case
In the iron ore mining industry, maintaining low silica content is essential to meet product specifications and ensure downstream processing efficiency. This project uses data from various flotation process parameters to predict the % of Silica in the output.

Our workflow includes:
- Data Collection: Downloading and understanding the dataset from the provided source.
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and correcting inconsistent entries.
- Feature Engineering: Creating additional features from timestamp or derived ratios.
- Model Training: Testing and tuning models like Random Forest, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting.
- Evaluation: Using MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² to evaluate prediction accuracy.
- Visualization: Plotting predicted vs. actual silica percentages for validation.

Predicted silica values can assist process engineers in identifying early warning signs and making real-time adjustments to reagent flow rates or pulp conditions.
