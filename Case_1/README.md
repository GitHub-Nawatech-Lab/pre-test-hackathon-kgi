# Reservoir Production Prediction using Machine Learning
## ðŸ§  Overview

This project aims to predict reservoir fluid production using machine learning techniques based on petrophysical and geophysical features derived from well log data. Accurate prediction of production rates supports better reservoir management, production optimization, and informed decision-making in hydrocarbon development projects.

By leveraging historical well data and rock properties, we train predictive models that estimate production outcomes, enabling more accurate planning and resource allocation.

## ðŸš€ Use Case
Understanding and forecasting production performance from subsurface formations is a core challenge in reservoir engineering. Traditional methods may fall short when data is noisy or incomplete. This project focuses on predicting fluid production volumes based on key rock and fluid indicators from well logs.

The workflow includes:
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and outliers.
- Feature Engineering: Selecting and transforming features for modeling.
- Model Training: Using ML algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- Evaluation: Using metrics like RMSE and RÂ² to evaluate model performance.
- Visualization: Comparing actual vs. predicted production for model validation.

Predicted values can be used to forecast productivity in undrilled locations or plan enhanced recovery strategies in existing wells.
